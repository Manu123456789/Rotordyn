Rotor dynamics is a pivotal field in mechanical engineering that involves the analysis of
lateral and torsional vibrations within rotating shaft systems, particularly within potentially high-stakes environments like turbine generators. Leveraging dynamic simulations
and detailed rotor bearing analysis, this report explains how flexible rotor geometries, coupled with high rotational speeds, influence vibration characteristics. The modeling of rotor
dynamics may allow for the implementation of Active Magnetic Bearings to enhance the
predictability and control of such vibrations, aiming to sustain operational stability above
critical speed thresholds. These systems require accurate modeling because they rely on
dependable model-based rotor levitation controllers for optimal operation.

Techniques relating to the development framework for finite element models aimed at
streamlining rotor dynamics analysis are presented in this report. An open-source software
suite based on rotor dynamics principles was reviewed, including examples that demonstrate its application in real-world scenarios. This software package will be used as a basis
to explore the development and verification of more specialized rotor dynamics analysis
tools. Simplified models can be tested as proof of concept to show the initial viability
and potential applications of this modeling approach in complex rotor-dynamic systems
in high-performance environments such as propulsion units and turbine generator applications.
